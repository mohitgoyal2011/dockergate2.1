# dockergate2
Docker has become a popular technology used by cloud services because of the ease of deployment and
process isolation provided to the applications. By default,Docker has access to a majority of system calls that are
made to the host kernel. This unrestricted access of system calls results in exposing a greater attack surface for sharing same kernel. Docker version 17.03 onwards includes support for a Seccomp profile that can allow or deny system calls that the applications inside a Docker container can make. However, it is impractical to manually define a Seccomp profile for a particular Docker image without innate knowledge of all executable code inside. In this work, we propose DockerGate, a platform that can statically analyze a Docker image to identify the system calls in the executable binaries. Our key insight here is that by analyzing the reachable, executable code, tighter Seccomp profiles can be generated which would reduce the attack surface of the Docker Container.The static analysis framework was developed as a pipeline that first generates a graph of the filesystem and then traverses the graph, analyzing each node for system calls. We test DockerGate by generating Seccomp policies for 40 Docker Images and running the Images within a container with the Seccomp policy applied. We achieve an average size of 230 system calls for a Seccomp policy as opposed to the Default policy of 300 system calls. We also manage to achieve basic functionality for 39 out of 42 containers
